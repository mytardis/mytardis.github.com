MyTardis Community Resources
============================

The main MyTardis project website is on [mytardis.org][1]

This repo and the associated Wiki are used to track community resources such as
apps and filters and provide a place to propose, discuss and agree on major
changes to the MyTardis code.

Due to technical limitations of the software, we collect the proposals in the
directory "_posts". If you have a proposal please submit a pull request to
add your file there.

The GitHub web interface allows creating files and editing and submitting
the changes via pull request.

The MyTardis Community resources website is managed by [Jekyll][2] and
[GitHub Pages][3].

You can check it out and run it on your own machine quite easily:

    sudo gem install jekyll
    git clone git://github.com/mytardis/mytardis.github.com.git
    cd mytardis.github.com
    jekyll --server --auto

If you'd like to submit content or fix typos, please fork this repository,
make your changes, then submit a pull request.
